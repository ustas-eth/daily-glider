### A personal blog for [Glider](https://glide.r.xyz/) queries, tips, and guides.

## What Is Glider

It's a security/research tool that lets you query multiple contracts on EVM blockchains at once by certain logic, parameters, dependencies, variable names, or anything else you can think of.

**Disclaimer!** Glider is still in beta; a lot of things to do, and a lot of things can go wrong. If you encounter any issues, please feel free to contact the team in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/remedy) channel.

## Quick Start

If you're already familiar with smart contracts in general, I'd suggest you to:

1. Go to the Glider [official website](https://glide.r.xyz/)
2. Register an account
3. Browse the provided basic queries
4. Try to run and see how it works

Otherwise, start with [this awesome repo](https://github.com/OffcierCia/DeFi-Developer-Road-Map)!
